# How Get Started with the ESP8266 and Micropython

## Requirements

+ Get esptool using

  `pip install esptool`

## Firmware

+ Download the latest firmware from <a href="http://micropython.org/download#esp8266" target="_blank">here</a>.

+ Erase the existing firmware using following command into a terminal:

  `esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash`

+ Go to the same directory as .bin file you dowloaded and enter the following command to install the firmware on your esp8266:

  `esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 write_flash --flash_size=detect -fm dio 0 [firmware.bin]`

+ Test that your firmware installed successfully

  Hard reset the board

  Try to start a REPL over the serial port using the following command:

  `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`

  Then press enter until you see `>>>`. This means that a REPL has been successfully created.

  To check that state of the firmware, enter the following commands into the REPL:

  ```python
  import esp
  esp.check_fw()
  ```
