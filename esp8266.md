# How Get Started with the ESP8266 and Micropython

## Requirements

* Get esptool using (using python3)

  `pip install esptool adafruit-ampy`

## Firmware

* Download the latest firmware from [here]("http://micropython.org/download#esp8266").

* Erase the existing firmware using following command into a terminal replacing PORT_OF_ESP8266 with your port
  (on Windows this will be something like "COM1" and on OSX and Linux it will start with "/dev/tty"):

  `esptool.py --port PORT_OF_ESP8266 erase_flash`

* Go to the same directory as .bin file you dowloaded and enter the following command to install the firmware on your esp8266:

  `esptool.py --port PORT_OF_ESP8266 --baud 115200 write_flash --flash_size=detect -fm dio 0 FIRMWARE_FILE.bin`

* Test that your firmware installed successfully

  Hard reset the board

  Try to start a REPL over the serial port using the following command:

  `sudo screen PORT_OF_ESP8266 115200`

  Then press enter until you see `>>>`. This means that a REPL has been successfully created.

  To check that state of the firmware, enter the following lines into the REPL:

  ```python
  import esp
  esp.check_fw()
  ```

* Setup up `boot.py` to run code on boot (setup as station)
  
  ```python
  # boot.py
  import gc
  import network
  sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF) # initialize stationary mode
  if not sta_if.isconnected():
    sta_if.active(True) # activate sta mode
    sta_if.connect('<ssid>', '<password>') # connect to wifi
    while not sta_if.isconnected():
      pass
  print(sta_if.ifconfig())
  gc.collect()
  ```
 
  Upload the `boot.py` file using ampy:

  `ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 put /path/to/boot.py`

<!---
## Enable WebREPL
  
In order to access a repl over wifi. WebREPL must be setup on the
esp8266 itself. To do this enter the following command when in the
the serial repl. Follow the prompts as desired.

```python
import webrepl_setup
```

*Note: The password created here is entered once connected to the
board using the webrepl it is not the password to the board if you choose to set it up as an access point.*

## Network Setup

In order to connect to the esp8266 using a web socket, you will need
to connect to the device in one of two ways. To start make sure that
you have a repl open via serial.

`screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`

Next import the network module:

```python
import network
```
--->

### Station Interface

The station interface allows users to connect to the esp8266 as if it were another
device on the network.

### Access Point Interface

The access point interface allows users to connect to the esp8266 as if it is an access point.
